          <h3>What is this?</h3>
          <p>I created this framework because I have to create small websites for projects, photos, code sharing, or anything else quite frequently.</p>
          <p>One day I got tired of copying existing websites I created in the past, then spend time on removing things I don't need, add things I do, change the colors, and so on ... So I put together a simple html framework that has all the features that I need on a constant basis, and is very simple and fast to deploy and update.</p>
          <p>This simple framework comes with components that I use the most:
            <ul>
              <li>JQuery</li>
              <li>Syntax Highlighter</li>
              <li>Fancybox</li>
              <li>A basic stylesheet.</li>
              <li>A responsive layout.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      
<?php include('footer.php'); ?>
